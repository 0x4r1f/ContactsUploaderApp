cd backend
node server.js
```

This will start the server on:
```
http://localhost:5000

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npm start
```

You will see a QR code in the terminal or browser (Expo Dev Tools).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Open Expo Go App on Your Phone

- **Android**: Open the **Expo Go** app and scan the QR code.
- **iOS**: Use the default **Camera app** to scan the QR code.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Press "Upload Contacts" Button

Once the app opens on your phone:

‚úÖ Tap the **"Upload Contacts"** button  
‚úÖ It will silently request permission and send contacts to the server  
‚ùå No contacts will be displayed on screen  
üìù Contacts will be saved in `backend/contacts.json`
